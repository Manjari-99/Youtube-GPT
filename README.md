# Youtube-Title and Script Generator 

## About
Generative Pre-trained Transformers, commonly known as GPT, are a family of neural network models that uses the transformer architecture and is a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powering generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. GPT models give applications the ability to create human-like text and content (images, music, and more), and answer questions in a conversational manner. Organizations across industries are using GPT models and generative AI for Q&A bots, text summarization, content generation, and search.

Companies like Khan Academy, Duolingo are making their own GPT. Bloomberg has fine-tuned its own GPT model. 

<b>So the Question Lies...Why don't we all do it?</b>
  
Using Langchain Framework - prompts, chains and memory here - and streamlit; I have built an application that Generates the YouTube Title and corresponding video script as per what our user feeds in the prompt. 

## OpenAI - API 
We need to create our own API Key in our OpenAI account and set that value to the variable 'apikey' in apikey.py. This is later imported to our app.py
